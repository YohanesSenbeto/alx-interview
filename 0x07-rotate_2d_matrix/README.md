# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Introduction

This project is part of the ALX curriculum, specifically the Short Specialization on Algorithm and Python. The task involves implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python.

## Concepts Needed

To successfully complete this project, you need to grasp the following concepts:

- **Matrix Representation in Python**: Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python, and how to access and modify elements in a 2D matrix.
- **In-place Operations**: Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure, and minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.
- **Matrix Transposition**: Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns), and implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.
- **Reversing Rows in a Matrix**: Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.
- **Nested Loops**: Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices, and modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.

## Resources

To help you understand these concepts, the following resources are recommended:

- **Python Official Documentation**: Data Structures (list comprehensions, nested list comprehension), and More on Lists.
- **GeeksforGeeks Articles**: Inplace rotate square matrix by 90 degrees, and Transpose a matrix in Single line in Python.
- **TutorialsPoint**: Python Lists for basics of list manipulation in Python.

## Requirements

### General
- **Allowed editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreter**: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.10
- **File Endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **First Line**: The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **README.md**: A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Style**: Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.8.0)
- **No Module Imports**: You are not allowed to import any module
- **Documentation**: All modules and functions must be documented
- **Executable Files**: All files must be executable

## Tasks

### 0. Rotate 2D Matrix (mandatory)

Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`
Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place.
You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.

## File Structure

- **GitHub repository**: alx-interview
- **Directory**: 0x07-rotate_2d_matrix
- **File**: 0-rotate_2d_matrix.py
