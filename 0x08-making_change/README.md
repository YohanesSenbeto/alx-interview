**0x08. Making Change**
=====================
**Project Description**
--------------------
This project involves solving the classic coin change problem using dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations.

**Requirements**
--------------
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* Python version: 3.4.3
* All files should end with a new line
* The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
* All files must be executable

**Task**
-----
* `0. Change comes from within`: Write a function `makeChange(coins, total)` that returns the fewest number of coins needed to meet the given total amount.

**Resources**
------------
* Python Official Documentation: More Control Flow Tools (for loops, if statements)
